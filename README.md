# Chaotic-Motion-of-the-Duffing-Oscillator
This repository contains my final project for Computational Physics 2, focusing on the Chaotic Motion of the Duffing Oscillator.

In this JuPyTer notebook, I introduce the Duffing Oscillator, and analyze its behavior in chaotic and deterministic conditions.
